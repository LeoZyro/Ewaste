        <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices and equipment that are no longer in use. This includes items such as old computers, mobile phones, televisions, refrigerators, and other consumer electronics. As technology advances rapidly, the lifespan of electronic devices is getting shorter, leading to an increase in the number of devices being discarded. E-waste is a significant concern because it often contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and other toxic chemicals, which can pose risks to human health and the environment if not disposed of properly. Additionally, e-waste contains valuable materials, including precious metals like gold, silver, and copper, which can be recovered and recycled, reducing the need for new resource extraction. Proper recycling and disposal of e-waste are crucial to prevent environmental contamination and to promote the sustainable use of resources.</p>
        <h2>Key facts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>E-waste is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world.</li>
            <li>In 2022, an estimated 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced globally. Only 22.3% was documented as formally collected and recycled .</li>
            <li>Lead is a common substance released into the environment when e-waste is recycled, stored or dumped using informal activities, including open burning.</li>
            <li>Informal e-waste recycling activities may have several adverse health effects. Children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable.</li>
            <li>ILO and WHO estimate that millions of women and child labourers working in the informal recycling sector globally may be at risk of hazardous e-waste exposures.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <h2>Overview</h2><hr>
        <p>Every year millions of electrical and electronic devices are discarded as products break or become obsolete and are thrown away. These discarded devices are considered e-waste and can become a threat to health and the environment if they are not disposed of and recycled appropriately.</p>
        <p>Common items in e-waste streams include computers, mobile phones, large household appliances, and medical equipment. Millions of tonnes of e-waste are recycled using unsound activities, as well as being stored in homes and warehouses, dumped, and illegally exported. When e-waste is recycling using unsound activities, it can release up to 1,000 different chemical substances into the environment, including known toxicants such as lead . Pregnant women and children are particularly vulnerable to these effects due to pathways of exposure and developmental status. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 16.5 million children were working in the industrial sector in 2020, of which waste processing is a subsector.</p>
    
        <h2>Scope of the problem</h2><hr>
        <p>Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world . Less than a quarter of e-waste produced globally in 2022 was known to be formally recycled; however, e-waste streams contain valuable and finite resources that can be reused if they are recycled appropriately. E-waste has therefore become an important income stream for individuals and some communities. People living in low- and middle-income (LMICs), particularly children, face the most significant risks from e-waste due to lack of appropriate regulations and enforcement, recycling infrastructure and training. Despite international regulations targeting the control of the transport of e-waste from one country to another, its transboundary movement to LMICs continues, frequently illegally. E-waste is considered hazardous waste as it contains toxic materials and can produce toxic chemicals when recycled inappropriately. Many of these toxic materials are known or suspected to cause harm to human health, and several are included in the 10 chemicals of public health concern, including dioxins, lead and mercury. Inferior recycling of e-waste is a threat to public health and safety. </p>
        <h2>Exposure to E-Waste</h2><hr>
        <p>Electrical and electronic items contain many different toxic substances. Users are unlikely to have contact with these substances while the items are functional. When they become waste, these toxicants can be released into the environment if the devices are managed using environmentally-unsound practices and activities. Many unsound practices have been observed at e-waste sites including:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Scavenging</li>
            <li>Dumping on land or in water bodies</li>
            <li>Landfilling along with regular waste</li>
            <li>Open burning or heating</li>
            <li>Acid baths or acid leaching</li>
            <li>Stripping and shredding plastic coatings</li>
            <li>Manual disassembly of equipment</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>These activities are considered hazardous to the environment and health as they release toxic pollutants, contaminating the air, soil, dust, and water at recycling sites and in neighbouring communities. Open burning and heating are considered the most hazardous activities due to the toxic fumes created. Once in the environment, these toxic pollutants can travel significant distances from the point of pollution, exposing people in faraway areas to hazardous substances.</p>
    
        <h2>Children are the Most Vulnerable</h2><hr>
        <p>Epidemiological research has posed several adverse health outcomes linked to informal and unsound e-waste recycling activities.</p>
        <p>Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to the effects of hazardous pollutants from informal e-waste recycling activities. Children are often involved in waste picking and scavenging, burning discarded e-waste and the manual dismantlement of items into component parts. In some countries, children may serve as a source of cheap labour and their small hands give them an advantage in taking apart the smallest items. These activities directly expose children to injury and high levels of hazardous substances. Working as a waste picker is hazardous labour and is considered one of the worst forms of child labour by the ILO. In 2020, the ILO estimated that as many as 16.5 million children globally were working in the industrial sector, of which waste processing is a subsector (4). It is unknown how many child labourers participate in informal e-waste recycling.</p>
    
        <p>E-waste exposure may be linked to the following health effects during pregnancy and in infants and children:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Adverse neonatal outcomes, including increased rates of stillbirth and premature birth;</li>
            <li>Neurodevelopment, learning, and behavior outcomes, especially associated with lead released through informal e-waste recycling activities;</li>
            <li>Reduced lung and respiratory function and increased asthma incidence, which may be linked to high levels of contaminated air pollution that characterize many e-waste recycling sites.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Children and pregnant women are at high risk to hazardous substances released through informal e-waste recycling activities due to their unique vulnerabilities. Children have different exposures to e-waste recycling activities than adults. E-waste recycling activities release toxic chemicals that can cross the placenta and may contaminate breastmilk, for example mercury. Fetuses and young children are highly sensitive to many pollutants released through e-waste recycling due to their rapidly developing bodies, including their respiratory, immune and central nervous systems. E-waste contains several known neurotoxicants, including lead and mercury, that may disrupt the development of the central nervous system during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence. Some harmful toxicants from e-waste may also impact the structural development and function of the lungs. Changes to childrenâ€™s developing systems may cause irreparable harm and affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>
    
        <h2>Prevention and Management</h2><hr>
        <p>National and international actions are essential to protect communities from unsound e-waste recycling activities. Actions that can be taken include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Adopting and enforcing high-level international agreements;</li>
            <li>Developing and implementing national e-waste management legislation that protects public health;</li>
            <li>Incorporating health protection measures into national legislation;</li>
            <li>Monitoring e-waste sites and surrounding communities;</li>
            <li>Implementing and monitoring interventions that improve informal e-waste recycling activities, protect public health and ensure vital sources of community revenue;</li>
            <li>Educating health workers across all levels on e-waste-related child health issues;</li>
            <li>Eliminating child labour.</li>
        </ul>
